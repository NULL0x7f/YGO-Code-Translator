# YGO-Code-Translator

This program is created for solving a problem that I always need to translate code in Mobile version YGO to that in PC version YGO by copying line by line.

With this program,you need just copy the code in your mobile phone into the 'input.txt' and then run the 'YGOCT.exe',then you will find your code that fit your PC version YGO in the 'output.txt'.
